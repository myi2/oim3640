# HomeHarvest Website: Real Estate Listings Scraper

## Project Overview

**The Big Idea:** HomeHarvest is a Python-based tool designed to automate the collection of real estate listings from various websites. Users can input criteria such as location, price range, and home features (e.g., number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage) to receive tailored property recommendations. The minimum viable product (MVP) will provide a list of homes matching these criteria, with stretch goals including a user-friendly web interface and integration with mapping APIs for enhanced searches.

**Team Members:** Adrien Schaal & Moises Yi

## Learning Objectives

- **Primary Objective:** Develop a Python-based web scraper to efficiently navigate and extract data from real estate websites.
- **Secondary Objective:** Master data manipulation to structure scraped data into a user-friendly format.
- **Tertiary Objective:** Explore machine learning algorithms to enhance property recommendations based on user preferences.

## The Challenge of Real Estate Search

Finding the right real estate listing can be a daunting task, especially when you have specific needs and preferences. Buyers and renters often struggle with:

- **Time-Consuming Searches:** Manually sifting through multiple websites and platforms to find listings that match specific criteria.
- **Data Overload:** Feeling overwhelmed by the sheer volume of available listings, many of which do not meet the searcher's needs.
- **Lack of Customization:** Difficulty in filtering searches to show only those properties that match all specified criteria such as location, price range, and features.
- **Recent Listings:** The challenge of finding the most current listings without trawling through outdated or already sold properties.

In a fast-moving real estate market, these challenges can lead to missed opportunities and a frustrating search experience.

## Our Solution: HomeHarvest Website

HomeHarvest seeks to alleviate these pain points by providing a centralized, automated scraping tool that:

- **Saves Time:** Quickly retrieves listings from various websites based on user-defined criteria.
- **Curates Content:** Delivers a focused selection of properties that precisely fit the user's search parameters.
- **Enhances Search Experience:** Simplifies the search process with an intuitive interface and advanced filtering capabilities.
- **Offers Fresh Data:** Ensures users get the most up-to-date listings by focusing on recently posted properties.

By streamlining the property search process, HomeHarvest aims to empower users, making their real estate search experience efficient, enjoyable, and effective.
