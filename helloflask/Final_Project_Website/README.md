# HomeHarvest: Real Estate Listings Scraper

## Project Overview

**The Big Idea:** HomeHarvest is a Python-based tool designed to automate the collection of real estate listings from various websites. Users can input criteria such as location, price range, and home features (e.g., number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage) to receive tailored property recommendations. The minimum viable product (MVP) will provide a list of homes matching these criteria, with stretch goals including a user-friendly web interface and integration with mapping APIs for enhanced searches.

**Team Members:** Adrien Schaal & Moises Yi

## Learning Objectives

- **Primary Objective:** Develop a Python-based web scraper to efficiently navigate and extract data from real estate websites.
- **Secondary Objective:** Master data manipulation to structure scraped data into a user-friendly format.
- **Tertiary Objective:** Explore machine learning algorithms to enhance property recommendations based on user preferences.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Tool Exploration:** Evaluate Python libraries such as Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, and Selenium for web scraping capabilities.
2. **Data Modeling:** Design a data model to effectively store and manipulate the scraped data.
3. **Website Selection:** Identify real estate websites that allow scraping and provide comprehensive data.
4. **Scraping Logic:** Develop scripts to extract listings based on user-defined criteria.
5. **Data Filtering:** Implement algorithms to sort and present relevant listings.
6. **Stretch Goals:** Build a web interface using Flask or Django for easy user interaction.
