On almost half an acre of land with no neighbors on either side, it's a light flooded gem. The hillside location creates additional separation from your neighbors and offers a great view of Van Cortlandt Park. The home has been lovingly and meticulously renovated, including the expansive windowed kitchen (which offers double sinks, double dishwashers and even two ovensone gas and one electric) and its five and half bathrooms. The renovations are not just for appearance; plumbing, electrical and HVAC have all been substantially upgraded. Entering through the gracious foyer, you are immediately drawn to the light streaming in through the expansive east facing windows and glass doors. On your right is a fabulous living room with a wood-burning fireplace and French doors out to the bluestone patio. To your left is a wonderful, paneled library with built-in bookshelves and a second fireplace. Also on the first floor is a powder room and the magnificent kitchen/great room, which encompasses the spacious dining room with its inviting window bench. The second floor offers a large primary suite with working fireplace, an office area and lovely bath, and Juliet balcony. On this level there are three additional roomy bedrooms, two more baths and abundant closet space. The full third floor serves as a recreational space with a den for television viewing, a wet bar, ping pong and more--most especially a glorious terrace overlooking Van Cortlandt Park. This level also offers an additional two full baths, and even more spacious storage. Outside, there are plenty of spaces to relax or entertain. The large back bluestone patio and a smaller bluestone terrace next to the kitchen are both perfect for entertaining and barbecuing. A walkway leads to the lower property with a seating area, and, of course, there is the sun-drenched third-floor terrace. On the lower level, there's a wine cellar and copious storage, plus an attached spacious garage. Few homes in the city offer this rare combination of space and privacy as well as easy access to the subway, Metro North, express busses, and local transportation, as well as shopping, Van Cortlandt Park horse riding stables & golf course, and great local restaurants. Area schools include the three hilltop private schools and two four-year colleges.

There is a long, private driveway (280 ft.) leading to a detached 2-car garage. There is a also a large storage shed. The property spans approximately 0.82 acres. THE HISTORY & ARCHITECTURE The main wing (known as the H.F. Spaulding Estate Coachman's House) was built around 1880 and designed by the architect Charles W. Clinton in the picturesque Victorian Stick style. The smaller wing was built around 1860. Both buildings were relocated to their current site from the Wave Hill estate across the street in 1909, and they were linked by a one-story addition in 1968. Historically and architecturally significant, the residence was designated a city landmark in 1981 and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. According to the Guide to New York City Landmarks, ""Lively and varied textures are created by board-and-batten siding on the first floor, crossed sticks above, dormer windows with jigsaw ornament, and a slate roof with overhanging eaves."" The authoritative AIA Guide to New York City (3rd Edition) uses one word to describe the Coachman's House: ""Glorious."" THE SETTING Situated on one of Riverdale's most bucolic avenues, and directly across from the exquisite greenery of Wave Hill public gardens and culture center, the home is close to well-known private schools (Horace Mann, Fieldston, Riverdale Country School and SAR Academy), the Riverdale Yacht Club and the Metro-North trains and express buses to Manhattan.",SINGLE_FAMILY,4970  Independence

Landmark with Sunroom, 2-Car Garage & Yard on a Third of an Acre, Zoned R4 In need of renovation, the old Hadley farm house is a 5-bedroom, 2.5-bath, stone and wood-frame structure that may be the oldest home in the Bronx. According to some historians, the main portion of the 18th century dwelling could have been built as early as 1747 (which would make it one year older than the nearby Van Cortlandt Mansion). The Hadley House was designated as a New York City landmark in 2000. The central portion of the house has stone walls nearly two feet thick. The supporting beams in the basement are tree trunks, slit in half, with the bark left on the round side. The house still has its original stone fireplace. In the late 19th century, a north wing was added, and in 1915-16, a south wing was added in an expansion and remodeling by the noted architect Dwight James Baum. Features include: an entry foyer; living room; formal dining room with wood-burning fireplace; eat-in kitchen; sunroom; mudroom; laundry room; detached 2-car garage. The 0.35-acre property measures 50 by 102.75 ft. (15, 413 sq. ft.) and is zoned R4. So bring your architect and your vision if you want to renovate or expand the house or develop the property further.

Also in the kitchen is a Bosch counter-depth stacked washer/dryer. Closet space is great in this apartment. The floor plan renovation included converting a hallway to closet space for the third bedroom and a large storage closet in the bedroom hall. The dining room's china cabinet was repurposed into a built-in home office with mirrored folding doors to enlarge the appearance and reflect light in the dining room. There's a large coat closet with a pocket door. The plaster walls throughout were skim coated, and all the ceilings were replaced including sound-proofing. The cove ceiling moldings were recreated in the living, dining, hallway and third bedroom areas and all lighting is recessed. The lights are full color spectrum Philips Hue bulbs, allowing one to control the lighting environment via smart home assistant or app. The moldings, windows and door jambs were replaced or stripped to the steel and are lead-free. Floors are sanded and refinished original hardwood. All windows are double pane insulated glass. The 3 bedrooms and living room have ceiling fans.

https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/3453182053,DENY,22749920,FOR_SALE,"Douglas Elliman has been retained on an exclusive basis to arrange the sale of 1122 Fox St, a 5, 280 sqft, four-unit, walk-up townhouse, in the Foxhurst section of the Bronx. This residential building contains four floor-through, oversized apartment units. Featuring 17 bedrooms in total the layout by floor consists of the following: Unit One -- three bedrooms and one bath, Unit Two -- four bedrooms and a bath, and Units Three and Four each have five bedrooms. A $250, 000 investment was made into the property in 2018, which contributes to its low operating costs and above-market cap rate. Tenants pay for their own electricity, cooking gas, and hot water, while the owner pays for the building's heat. With the current income, the property boasts a cap rate of 9.1%, and given the updated rent guidelines an investor could achieve almost 11% as the leases are renewed. Local shopping and restaurants are along the Westchester Ave and Southern Blvd commercial corridors. Conveniently located along the MTA's number 2 and 5 train lines, the building is only two blocks from the Simpson Street station, for a 40-minute ride into Midtown.
